<h2>
<a id="1-prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#1-prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1 Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You will need to have installed Python 3. In this link, Python you’ll find the
latest Python’s version. You could install it in every OS and use it without any
problem.
Also you’ll need the library Tkinter, if it is not install in your Python ver-
sion. You could find more information of the library and the installation here:
TKinter.</p>

<a id="2-what-im-going-to-find" class="anchor" href="#2-what-im-going-to-find" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2 What I’m going to find?</h2>

<p>Here you are going to find 2 things:</p>

<p>• <strong>Samples Folder:</strong> Here is where you have to put the samples images. Also
you can find here a Python’s script to resize all the images. This script
only works in Linux.</p>

<p>• <strong>toothtest.py:</strong> This is the main program. We’ll learn more about it later.</p>

<h2>
<a id="3-how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#3-how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 How it works?</h2>

<p>You have to run the gingiva.py script. There are different ways of doing it:</p>

<p>• In Windows you could just double click it and then it would run.</p>

<p>• In Unix based system, you could use your terminal and type: python3
toothtest.py</p>

<p>After using it, you will find that a .txt file have been created with all the choices
that your observer have made.</p>

<h2>
<a id="4-toothtestpy" class="anchor" href="#4-toothtestpy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4 toothtest.py</h2>

<p>In the program you are going to find different parts. The only parts you must
be concern about, are the lines where you find the words: <strong>screen_width and</strong>
<strong>screen_height</strong>, for example:</p>

<p><code># set first image on canvas
        """ You can change the place of the images giving
        different values to the screen_width and screen_height """
        self.image_on_canvas = self.canvas.create_image((screen_width/2)-100, screen_height/2, anchor = NW, image = self.my_images[self.my_image_number])
        self.texto = self.canvas.create_text(80,50,font=("Purisa", 16),text = "Sample 1")
</code></p>

<p>This is used to set the position in the screen. It detect your screen’s size and
assign the width to screen width and the height to screen height. You can figure
out that it’s divided by 2 because we want it in the middle of the screen. So,
you can change every number in the Python’s script to adjust perfectly to you
screen’s size.</p>

<h2>
<a id="5-the-ui" class="anchor" href="#5-the-ui" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5 The UI</h2>

<p>First what you’re going to see is this window:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/pacocp/ToothTest/blob/master/Documentation/first.png" alt="First thing you're going to see"></p>

<p>Here you can write the description of the observer.Also, you’ll see the ob-
servers names that have already passed the test. This is going to be used to
create the file were the results are going to be written in.
Then you’ll see the main window:
<img src="https://github.com/pacocp/ToothTest/blob/master/Documentation/second.png" alt="Main Window"></p>

<p>So, you can see you have different buttons. Let’s talk a little bit about them:</p>

<p>• <strong>Close:</strong> it close the window, as it name says.</p>

<p>• <strong>Previous/Next Sample:</strong> it change to the next or previous image.</p>

<p>• <strong>Perceptibility:</strong> If you can perceive color differences hit YES. Otherwise
hit NO and you can change the sample.</p>

<p>• <strong>Acceptability:</strong> If you accept the color differences that you perceive hit
YES. Otherwise hit NO. Keep going with the scale.</p>

<p>• <strong>Scale:</strong> Choose one number between 0 and 5. 0 is that you don’t percieve
any difference and 5 if they are very different. Then you can change the
sample.</p>

<p>In your left side of the screen you have the sample’s number.</p>

<h2>
<a id="6-which-files-are-going-to-be-created" class="anchor" href="#6-which-files-are-going-to-be-created" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6 Which files are going to be created?</h2>

<p>You’ll find that several files and folders are going to be created:</p>

<p>• <strong>Observers Evaluation:</strong> Here is where the results are goint to be saved.
All of them have the name: observer”number of the observer”.txt .</p>

<p>• <strong>observers.txt:</strong> Here ir where the names of the observers who have already
passed the test are going to be stored.</p>

<h2>
<a id="7-variables-that-i-need-to-change-in-the-code" class="anchor" href="#7-variables-that-i-need-to-change-in-the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7 Variables that I need to change in the code</h2>

<p>This is a very important part of the documentation. You need to set the number
of samples that are going to be used as samples, of course. You can change it
in this line of code:</p>

<p><code>#change the number in range and the name depend on your necesities
        for i in range(1,180):
            self.my_images.append(PhotoImage(file = "Samples/muestra"+str(i)+".png"))
</code></p>

<p>Here you can change two things:</p>

<p>• <strong>The range:</strong> You can change the number of images that you have. In the
example above, you have 180, you need to change the second number in
range(1,180) to the number of samples you have.</p>

<p>• <strong>The name of the samples:</strong> all the samples need to have the same name
follow a number, which goes from 1 to the number of samples you have.</p>
