In this link, Python you’ll find the\r\nlatest Python’s version. You could install it in every OS and use it without any\r\nproblem.\r\nAlso you’ll need the library Tkinter, if it is not install in your Python ver-\r\nsion. You could find more information of the library and the installation here:\r\nTKinter.\r\n\r\n## 2 What I’m going to find?\r\n\r\nHere you are going to find 2 things:\r\n\r\n• **Samples Folder:** Here is where you have to put the samples images. Also\r\nyou can find here a Python’s script to resize all the images. This script\r\nonly works in Linux.\r\n\r\n• **toothtest.py:** This is the main program. We’ll learn more about it later.\r\n\r\n## 3 How it works?\r\nYou have to run the gingiva.py script. There are different ways of doing it:\r\n\r\n• In Windows you could just double click it and then it would run.\r\n\r\n• In Unix based system, you could use your terminal and type: python3\r\ntoothtest.py\r\n\r\nAfter using it, you will find that a .txt file have been created with all the choices\r\nthat your observer have made.\r\n\r\n## 4 toothtest.py\r\nIn the program you are going to find different parts. The only parts you must\r\nbe concern about, are the lines where you find the words: **screen_width and**\r\n**screen_height**, for example:\r\n\r\n`# set first image on canvas\r\n        \"\"\" You can change the place of the images giving\r\n        different values to the screen_width and screen_height \"\"\"\r\n        self.image_on_canvas = self.canvas.create_image((screen_width/2)-100, screen_height/2, anchor = NW, image = self.my_images[self.my_image_number])\r\n        self.texto = self.canvas.create_text(80,50,font=(\"Purisa\", 16),text = \"Sample 1\")\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis is used to set the position in the screen. It detect your screen’s size and\r\nassign the width to screen width and the height to screen height. You can figure\r\nout that it’s divided by 2 because we want it in the middle of the screen. So,\r\nyou can change every number in the Python’s script to adjust perfectly to you\r\nscreen’s size.\r\n\r\n## 5 The UI\r\nFirst what you’re going to see is this window:\r\n\r\n![First thing you're going to see](https://github.com/pacocp/ToothTest/blob/master/Documentation/first.png)\r\n\r\nHere you can write the description of the observer.Also, you’ll see the ob-\r\nservers names that have already passed the test. This is going to be used to\r\ncreate the file were the results are going to be written in.\r\nThen you’ll see the main window:\r\n![Main Window](https://github.com/pacocp/ToothTest/blob/master/Documentation/second.png)\r\n\r\nSo, you can see you have different buttons. Let’s talk a little bit about them:\r\n\r\n• **Close:** it close the window, as it name says.\r\n\r\n• **Previous/Next Sample:** it change to the next or previous image.\r\n\r\n• **Perceptibility:** If you can perceive color differences hit YES. Otherwise\r\nhit NO and you can change the sample.\r\n\r\n• **Acceptability:** If you accept the color differences that you perceive hit\r\nYES. Otherwise hit NO. Keep going with the scale.\r\n\r\n• **Scale:** Choose one number between 0 and 5. 0 is that you don’t percieve\r\nany difference and 5 if they are very different. Then you can change the\r\nsample.\r\n\r\nIn your left side of the screen you have the sample’s number.\r\n\r\n## 6 Which files are going to be created?\r\nYou’ll find that several files and folders are going to be created:\r\n\r\n• **Observers Evaluation:** Here is where the results are goint to be saved.\r\nAll of them have the name: observer”number of the observer”.txt .\r\n\r\n• **observers.txt:** Here ir where the names of the observers who have already\r\npassed the test are going to be stored.\r\n\r\n## 7 Variables that I need to change in the code\r\nThis is a very important part of the documentation. You need to set the number\r\nof samples that are going to be used as samples, of course. You can change it\r\nin this line of code:\r\n\r\n`#change the number in range and the name depend on your necesities\r\n        for i in range(1,180):\r\n            self.my_images.append(PhotoImage(file = \"Samples/muestra\"+str(i)+\".png\"))\r\n`\r\n\r\nHere you can change two things:\r\n\r\n• **The range:** You can change the number of images that you have. In the\r\nexample above, you have 180, you need to change the second number in\r\nrange(1,180) to the number of samples you have.\r\n\r\n• **The name of the samples:** all the samples need to have the same name\r\nfollow a number, which goes from 1 to the number of samples you have.",
